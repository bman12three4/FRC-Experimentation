# FRC Experimentation
## Java
This code is intented to be run on the RoboRIO and is the brains of the operation. 
Some skills that we would like to have or improve upon are:
 * Command Based Programming
 * Using sensors, such as encoders
 * PID
 * Networking to the Raspberry Pi vision co-processor.
 We hope that by learning about these we can create much more elegant and functional code for next years FRC challenge, **_FIRST_** Steamworks.
 
## Python
This code is for the raspberry pi, which is being used to take some of the load off of the RIO by doing image processing.
We hope to use image processing in the next games because it is a very powerful tool to have, especially during autonomous modes, where
the robot must be able to aim by itself.
Our skills we would like to work on are:
 * Getting used to python
 * Using OpenCV
 * Creating contour reports
 * Sending data either over UDP or NetworkTables
 * Using a co-processor to lighten the load on the RIO
